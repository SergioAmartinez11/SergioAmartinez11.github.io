        <h3 class="bio-title">About me</h3> 
        <div class="bio-panel">
            <p>Born in Tijuana on September 11, 1998, 
                I was the second child of my parents Sergio and Gabriela, 
                who had just moved to live in Rosarito. 
                I spend the first five years of my life mostly 
                in my grandparent's restaurant in Puerto nuevo where my 
                parents also worked. At the age of five, I was in Carmen Cerdan's 
                kindergarten where I could play a lot with all the other kids and 
                also had my first English class ever, the first English words that 
                I learned were colors and numbers. Due to my age, I could only be in 
                kindergarten for one year, after that, I went to elementary school for 
                the next six years of my life, making new friends, new experiences, and 
                trying sports for the first time. I was enrolled in Pedro Moreno elementary 
                school as my sister was. There I was able to meet some really good friends and 
                some of them still are. In my fifth grade summer, I tried to play baseball on 
                my best friend's team but eventually quit, to play basketball. Finally, in my sixth grade, I 
                discover what computers can do if you know how to use them and I was amazed by them. 
            <p>
                At thirteen I was attending the Amado Nervo middle 
                school and signed to the computer lab class for the next 
                three years of my life. It was a very interesting part of my life 
                because I struggle to make friends but enjoyed learning about all sorts of topics, 
                especially computer science. I start being serious about basketball and trained 
                every day after class with the idea of playing high school basketball and eventually 
                in college. Middle school wasn't the best part of my life but it set what I am now.
            </p>    
                <p>
                After that, I got into high school, Cobach Rosarito. 
                I was first picked in the high school basketball tryouts 
                as a freshman and that was a goal for me. I fit into the team, 
                all my teammates were great guys and good players. Played for three 
                years and the highest we got was winning a state tournament but we didn't 
                pass the nationals. My high school years were the best, I met amazing people 
                and friends, also was a stage of discovering myself in different areas such as 
                personal relations, what I like to do, and what I don't like. Found new hobbies 
                and my extreme love for coffee. My curiosity for programming and computer sciences 
                increased and I give myself the task of learning the basics of software development 
                for a future college career. At this point, I began to explore all the different options 
                for university, and end up finding out that computer engineering at UABC was the best 
                option for me. 
            
                After passing the test for getting into university 
                I was finally in my dream career and excited for the upcoming.

                    to the states or a different country. 
                    Also having personal side projects like a coffee shop with

            <div class="computer-background">
            <div class="computer-box">
                <p>I'm studying my sixth semester 
                    of computer engineering at The Faculty 
                    of Chemical Science and Engineering. So far it 
                    has been a great experience with ups and downs. 
                    The most difficult part of my career 
                    for me was designing complex digital circuits.</p>
                <p>
                Computer engineering is a branch 
                of electronic engineering where you have 
                to learn a lot from hardware design, and software 
                design, and how to integrate both to create a 
                functional system. By the end of your bachelor's, 
                you'll have training in software engineering and 
                electronic engineering, making it a very complete and 
                extensive professional career.</p>
